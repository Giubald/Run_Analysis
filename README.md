Files
1) run_analysis.R performs the data preparation in which the required 5 steps from the project are performed in order to clean the dataset
   - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
   - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
   - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
   - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
2) CodeBook.md that describes all the variables, with the correct labels and any transformations to clean up the data
3) final data export "AverageSet_ordered.txt"
4) README.md file, to describe the content of the repository
